Heya! I'm Brandon, and I guess I got this blog now :)

I've toyed with the idea of writing for a while, mostly just my thoughts on topics like esports and posting tutorials for myself because I tend to forget stuff.

The final push came when I had to blog as a part of my coursework for my Grade 12 English class last semester. It turned out to be pretty fun, so here we are. (Thanks, Mx Schneider!)

At this point, I have no plans to be super serious about this, going to aim for 2-3 posts a month but no biggie if I don't meet that.

See ya soon :)
