1. Went to Gatsby Starter templates and looked through
    - Took me a while to decide
    - Settled on Minimal Blog by LekoArts
2. Cloned and setup locally + pushed to github
3. Customizing the theme with Gatsby Shadowing
    - You need your own src folder
    - In node modules it was `node_modules/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/src/*`
    - In mine it was `blog/src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/*`
    - Didn't work for me at first, had to delete .cache and restart `gatsby develop`
